My ZMK config for my corne keyboard.
![My Corne Layout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/788c8a56-22fc-4c24-91c0-e55e2a5c5f5c)

I was getting a little frustrated when starting to use the keyboard that windows is wonky with different language inputs.
Having to often juggle between my pc's randomly switching between Danish or English keyboard input was frustrating so i am making this to 
translate it to go fully danish at all times. But still being able to use colemakDH with Miryoku because of the Home Row Mods (HRM).

I Couldn't for the life of me figure my way around how to configure just a few keys in Miryoku so i could just use ÆØÅ.
So i ended up Starting this config so can once again input strange glØphs to the internet worry free.

For the Home Row Mods i used the settings coming from urob https://github.com/urob/zmk-config 
Which so far seems to work just as good as miryoku native.

I grabbed some of the Macros from pinkvinus config for the symbols hidden behind using ALT GR. Thank you https://github.com/Pinkvinus/zmk-aurora-corne-danish

For now this is the most basic form later on i hope to get mouse key functionality working, and media controls.
